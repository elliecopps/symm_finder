# symm_finder
The sym_mod file contains all of the functions used to find symmetries in systems of spins.

Running the Symmetry_Finder file from the command line with arguments N, seed, max_energy will return symmetries from all energy levels up to max_energy for a system of N spins arranged with the Jij matrix specified by the seed.

sym_mod.pyc is a Jupyter Notebook with all of the functions that I use.
